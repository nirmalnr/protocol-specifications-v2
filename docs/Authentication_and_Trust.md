## Abstract

This document defines the authentication and trust model for Beckn Protocol v2.0.0. It specifies how network participants (BAPs, BPPs, and DSes) prove their identity and establish non-repudiation on every message leg of a Beckn interaction using Ed25519 digital signatures over a canonical signing string, keyed to identities registered on the fabric's Global Root Registry.

## Context

Beckn Protocol enables bilateral, asynchronous value-exchange interactions between independent network participants (NPs) — Beckn Application Platforms (BAPs), Beckn Provider Platforms (BPPs), and Discovery Services (DSes) — that have no pre-established trust relationship beyond their shared registration on the fabric. Every message in a Beckn interaction crosses trust boundaries: the receiver cannot assume the sender is who it claims to be, and cannot assume the payload was not tampered with in transit.

The trust model in both Beckn Protocol v1.x and v2.0 is identical in principle: each NP independently authenticates inbound messages by fetching the sender's registered public key from a verified public registry and verifying the Ed25519 signature over the message body. The Beckn Gateway (BG), present in v1.x, was a routing intermediary — it forwarded requests between BAPs and BPPs — but it was never the source of trust and was not an authentication component. The structural change in v2.0 is the registry protocol. In v1.x, NPs issued Beckn Protocol-format API calls to query subscriber records from a Beckn-compliant registry. In v2.0, NPs issue dedi (Decentralized Directory) protocol-format API calls to query namespace and key records from a dedi-compliant registry. The GRR at `fabric.nfh.global/registry` is the canonical v2.0 registry; it is not a Beckn API and implements no Beckn endpoint. The removal of the BG simplifies the message flow to direct BAP ↔ BPP/DS communication but does not change the underlying trust mechanism.

This RFC specifies: (a) the key identity format that binds a signing key to a fabric-registered namespace; (b) the signing string construction that commits the sender's identity to a specific message body and time window; (c) the request signing procedure; (d) the synchronous response signing procedure that enables the sender to verify authenticated receipt; (e) the callback signing procedure that chains the BPP's signature to the BAP's original request signature; (f) the pre-call verification procedure for NPs on the same network; and (g) replay protection rules for BAP requests and BPP callbacks.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described [here](./Keyword_Definitions.md). These definitions aim to ensure that the terms are understood precisely and consistently to avoid confusion in the interpretation of standards, specifications, and protocols.

### Definitions

- **NP (Network Participant):** Any entity participating in a Beckn interaction — BAP, BPP, or DS.
- **BAP (Beckn Application Platform):** The NP that initiates value-exchange requests on behalf of consumers.
- **BPP (Beckn Provider Platform):** The NP that receives value-exchange requests and responds to them via asynchronous callbacks.
- **DS (Discovery Service):** The NP that indexes catalogs published by BPPs and responds to discovery requests from BAPs.
- **CS (Cataloging Service):** The fabric service that receives, validates, and indexes catalogs submitted by BPPs and distributes them to DSes.
- **GRR (Global Root Registry):** The fabric's canonical identity and address lookup service, hosted at `fabric.nfh.global/registry`, operated by the Networks for Humanity Foundation.
- **dedi protocol:** The Decentralized Directory protocol used by the GRR for namespace and key management.
- **keyId:** A structured string that uniquely identifies a signing key registered on a dedi-protocol registry.
- **Signing string:** The canonical byte sequence that is signed and verified using Ed25519.
- **Body digest:** The BLAKE2b-512 hash of the HTTP request or response body, encoded as described in §3.1.
- **request-signature:** The raw Ed25519 signature value extracted from a BAP's `Authorization` header and included verbatim in a BPP's callback signing string to chain the two message legs together.
- **Implicit keyId:** A keyId that uses a path-only format and is resolved exclusively via the GRR at `fabric.nfh.global/registry`.
- **Explicit keyId:** A keyId that embeds the full registry URL, allowing resolution against any dedi-protocol compliant registry.
- **Provider-initiated notification:** A callback sent by a BPP to a BAP's `/on_*` endpoint without a preceding BAP request in the current message exchange. Only endpoints designated as supporting provider-initiated notifications in the Beckn Protocol API specification may send them.
- **Solicited callback:** A callback sent by a BPP to a BAP's `/on_*` endpoint in direct response to a prior BAP request accepted with a `200 Ack`.

### Normative Requirements

#### 1. Cryptographic Primitives

All Beckn authentication MUST use the following primitives:

| Primitive | Value |
|---|---|
| Signature algorithm | Ed25519 (as specified in RFC 8032) |
| Body hash algorithm | BLAKE2b-512 (as specified in RFC 7693) |
| Body hash encoding | Standard Base64 with `=` padding (RFC 4648 §4) |
| Timestamp format | Unix epoch integer (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) |

No other signature or hash algorithm is permitted. An NP that receives a message carrying an `algorithm` value other than `ed25519` MUST reject it with a `401 NackUnauthorized`.

#### 2. Key Identity — the keyId Field

Every Beckn HTTP Signature carries a `keyId` field that uniquely identifies the signing key. The `keyId` MUST take exactly one of two formats: implicit or explicit.

##### 2.1 Implicit Format

```
{namespace_id}/{registry_id}/{record_id}|{algorithm}
```

- `{namespace_id}` — the NP's namespace on the fabric, as registered via the Namespacing Service.
- `{registry_id}` — the registry within that namespace that holds the key record.
- `{record_id}` — the specific record identifier within the registry.
- `{algorithm}` — MUST be `ed25519`.
- The three path components are separated by `/`; the algorithm is separated from the path by `|`.

An implicit keyId MUST be resolvable via the fabric's Global Root Registry only. Verifying NPs MUST treat an implicit keyId as residing at `https://fabric.nfh.global/registry` and MUST NOT attempt to resolve it against any other registry.

**Example:**
```
example-bap.beckn.io/keys/signing-key-001|ed25519
```

##### 2.2 Explicit Format

```
https://{registry_domain}/{namespace_id}/{registry_id}/{record_id}|{algorithm}
```

- The full URL up to (but not including) the `|` separator is a dedi protocol-compliant registry URL that resolves to the key record.
- `{algorithm}` — MUST be `ed25519`.
- The algorithm is appended after the URL using the `|` separator.

An explicit keyId instructs the verifier to resolve the public key from the specified registry URL rather than from the GRR. The target URL MUST be a dedi protocol-compliant registry. NPs MAY choose not to trust registries outside `fabric.nfh.global/registry`; in that case they MUST reject signatures carrying explicit keyIds from untrusted registries with a `401 NackUnauthorized`.

**Example:**
```
https://registry.example-nfo.io/example-bpp.beckn.io/keys/signing-key-001|ed25519
```

##### 2.3 Key Lookup Procedure

###### For implicit keyIds

The verifying NP MUST fetch the public key by issuing an HTTP GET request to:

```
https://fabric.nfh.global/registry/dedi/lookup/{keyId}
```

where `{keyId}` is the full implicit keyId string — including the `|algorithm` suffix — appended to the path **without URL-encoding**. The `|` and `/` characters MUST be transmitted as literal characters in the path.

**Example lookup URL:**
```
https://fabric.nfh.global/registry/dedi/lookup/example-bap.beckn.io/keys/signing-key-001|ed25519
```

###### For explicit keyIds

The verifying NP MUST extract the URL portion (everything before `|`) and issue an HTTP GET to that URL to retrieve the key record.

In both cases, the verifying NP MUST:

1. Confirm the `algorithm` suffix matches the `algorithm` field in the `Authorization` header. If they differ, reject with `401`.
2. Extract the public key from the registry response.
3. Verify the Ed25519 signature using that public key.
4. If the lookup fails or returns no key, reject with `401`.

#### 3. Signing String Construction

The signing string is a newline-delimited (`\n`) sequence of labeled values. The order of lines MUST match the order of field names declared in the `headers` attribute of the `Authorization` header.

##### 3.1 Body Digest

The body digest is computed as:

```
digest = "BLAKE2b-512=" + Base64( BLAKE2b-512( UTF-8(body) ) )
```

- `body` is the raw UTF-8-encoded HTTP request or response body as it appears on the wire, before any transfer encoding is removed.
- For requests with no body (e.g. GET), the digest MUST be computed over the empty byte string.
- The prefix `BLAKE2b-512=` is a literal string prepended to the Base64-encoded hash.

##### 3.2 Standard Signing String

Used for all outbound BAP requests and all synchronous responses:

```
(created): {created_unix_ts}
(expires): {expires_unix_ts}
digest: {body_digest}
```

Each line consists of the field name, a colon, a single space, and the value. Lines are separated by a single newline character (`\n`). No trailing newline.

- `{created_unix_ts}` — the Unix timestamp at which the signature was generated. MUST NOT be in the future at the time of verification.
- `{expires_unix_ts}` — the Unix timestamp at which the signature expires. MUST be greater than `{created_unix_ts}`. MUST NOT be in the past at the time of verification. MUST NOT exceed the expiry of the signing key's registration.
- `{body_digest}` — the body digest as defined in §3.1.

##### 3.3 Callback Signing String

Used exclusively when the BPP sends a solicited callback to the BAP's `/on_*` endpoint. The BPP MUST append a fourth line containing the BAP's original request signature:

```
(created): {created_unix_ts}
(expires): {expires_unix_ts}
digest: {callback_body_digest}
request-signature: {bap_signature_value}
```

- `{callback_body_digest}` — digest of the **callback** request body (not the original BAP request body).
- `{bap_signature_value}` — the raw Base64-encoded Ed25519 signature value extracted from the BAP's `Authorization` header's `signature="..."` field. This MUST be the literal string value of the `signature` attribute only, without the surrounding quotes or any other Authorization header components.

The `headers` attribute of the BPP's callback `Authorization` header MUST declare all four fields in order: `"(created) (expires) digest request-signature"`.

#### 4. Request Signing — BAP and BPP

Every Beckn HTTP request — whether initiated by a BAP (to a BPP or DS) or by a BPP (callback to a BAP) — MUST carry an `Authorization` header in the following format:

```
Authorization: Signature keyId="{keyId}",algorithm="ed25519",created="{created}",expires="{expires}",headers="{headers_list}",signature="{base64_signature}"
```

Attribute definitions:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `keyId` | string | The signing key identifier in implicit or explicit format (§2). |
| `algorithm` | string | MUST be `ed25519`. |
| `created` | integer string | Unix timestamp of signature creation. |
| `expires` | integer string | Unix timestamp of signature expiry. |
| `headers` | string | Space-separated list of fields included in the signing string. For BAP requests and provider-initiated notifications: `"(created) (expires) digest"`. For BPP solicited callbacks: `"(created) (expires) digest request-signature"`. |
| `signature` | string | Standard Base64 encoding of the Ed25519 signature over the signing string. |

The signing procedure for a request is:

1. Serialize the request body to UTF-8.
2. Compute the body digest (§3.1).
3. Construct the signing string (§3.2 for BAP requests and provider-initiated notifications; §3.3 for BPP solicited callbacks).
4. Sign the UTF-8 encoding of the signing string using the NP's Ed25519 private key.
5. Base64-encode the resulting 64-byte signature.
6. Assemble the `Authorization` header value as specified above.

#### 5. Synchronous Response Signing

Every synchronous HTTP response — regardless of status code (200, 400, 401, 409, 429, 500) — MUST carry a `Signature` response header. This header proves that the responding NP authenticated, received, and processed the request, establishing non-repudiation for the synchronous leg.

The `Signature` response header uses the same format as the request `Authorization` header but:

- The header name is `Signature`, not `Authorization`.
- The body digest is computed over the **response** body.
- The signing string is the standard signing string (§3.2).
- The signer is the responding NP (BPP or DS for incoming requests; BAP for incoming callbacks).

```
Signature: keyId="{keyId}",algorithm="ed25519",created="{created}",expires="{expires}",headers="(created) (expires) digest",signature="{base64_signature}"
```

The signing procedure for a synchronous response is:

1. Serialize the response body to UTF-8.
2. Compute the body digest (§3.1).
3. Construct the standard signing string (§3.2).
4. Sign the UTF-8 encoding of the signing string using the responding NP's Ed25519 private key.
5. Base64-encode the 64-byte signature.
6. Add the `Signature` header to the HTTP response.

The sending NP SHOULD verify the `Signature` response header upon receiving a synchronous response, using the responding NP's public key fetched via the key lookup procedure (§2.3). A missing or invalid `Signature` response header does not invalidate the transaction but SHOULD be logged and MAY be treated as a degraded trust signal.

#### 6. Callback Signing — BPP to BAP

When the BPP sends a solicited callback to the BAP's `/on_*` endpoint, it MUST sign the callback using the callback signing string (§3.3), which chains the BPP's signature to the BAP's original request signature. This chain allows the BAP to verify that the callback is a genuine response to a request it actually sent.

The BPP MUST:

1. Retrieve the BAP's `Authorization` header from the original request that triggered this callback.
2. Extract the raw Base64 signature value from the BAP's `Authorization` header's `signature="..."` attribute. This value becomes `{bap_signature_value}`.
3. Compute the body digest of the callback request body (§3.1).
4. Construct the callback signing string (§3.3) using the BPP's own `{created}` and `{expires}` timestamps, the callback body digest, and `{bap_signature_value}`.
5. Sign the UTF-8 encoding of the signing string with the BPP's Ed25519 private key.
6. Assemble the `Authorization` header with `headers="(created) (expires) digest request-signature"`.

The BPP MUST retain the BAP's original `Authorization` header value at least until the callback has been successfully acknowledged (200 Ack) by the BAP, to support retries.

For provider-initiated notifications (§10.3), the BPP MUST omit the `request-signature` field and MUST use the standard signing string (§3.2) with `headers="(created) (expires) digest"`.

#### 7. Verifying a Callback — BAP Procedure

Upon receiving a callback at its `/on_*` endpoint, the BAP MUST perform the following verification steps in order. If any step fails, the BAP MUST return `401 NackUnauthorized`.

##### Step 1 — Parse the Authorization header

Extract `keyId`, `algorithm`, `created`, `expires`, `headers`, and `signature` from the BPP's `Authorization` header.

##### Step 2 — Validate timestamps

Confirm that `created` is not in the future beyond the subnet-configured clock skew tolerance (default: 5 seconds) and that `expires` is not in the past.

##### Step 3 — Validate algorithm

Confirm `algorithm` is `ed25519`. Reject any other value.

##### Step 4 — Fetch the BPP's public key

Use the key lookup procedure (§2.3) to retrieve the BPP's Ed25519 public key.

##### Step 5 — Reconstruct the signing string

Using the `headers` field as the ordered list of fields:

- If `headers` is `"(created) (expires) digest"`: reconstruct the standard signing string (§3.2) using the `created` and `expires` values from the BPP's `Authorization` header and the BLAKE2b-512 digest of the received callback body. This is a provider-initiated notification.
- If `headers` is `"(created) (expires) digest request-signature"`: reconstruct the callback signing string (§3.3) using the above plus the value on the `request-signature` line. This is a solicited callback; proceed to Step 7.

##### Step 6 — Verify the BPP's Ed25519 signature

Verify the decoded `signature` against the reconstructed signing string using the BPP's public key. If verification fails, reject with `401`.

##### Step 7 — Verify the request-signature chain (solicited callbacks only)

If `headers` contains `request-signature`:

1. Retrieve the `signature` value from the BAP's own stored outbound `Authorization` header for the message identified by `context.transactionId` and `context.messageId` from the callback's `context` object.
2. Compare it to the `{bap_signature_value}` extracted from the reconstructed signing string's `request-signature` line.
3. If they do not match, reject with `401`. This mismatch indicates the callback was not issued in response to a request the BAP sent.

##### Step 8 — Return Ack

If all steps pass, return `200 Ack` with the BAP's own `Signature` response header (§5).

#### 8. Verifying a Request — BPP and DS Procedure

Upon receiving a request from a BAP, the BPP or DS MUST perform the following verification steps. If any step fails, it MUST return `401 NackUnauthorized`.

1. Parse `keyId`, `algorithm`, `created`, `expires`, `headers`, and `signature` from the `Authorization` header.
2. Confirm `created` is not in the future beyond the subnet-configured clock skew tolerance (default: 5 seconds) and `expires` is not in the past.
3. Confirm `algorithm` is `ed25519`.
4. Fetch the BAP's public key using the key lookup procedure (§2.3).
5. Reconstruct the standard signing string (§3.2) using the `created` and `expires` values and the BLAKE2b-512 digest of the received request body.
6. Verify the decoded `signature` against the signing string using the BAP's public key.
7. Return `200 Ack` with the responding NP's `Signature` response header (§5), or the appropriate error response.

#### 9. Pre-call NP Verification

Before sending any Beckn request or callback, the sending NP SHOULD verify that the receiving NP is still active and authorized to participate on the network.

##### 9.1 Subscriber Reference Lookup (Same-Network NPs)

When both the sending and receiving NP are members of the same subnet (i.e. they share the same `networkId` registered with the same NFO), the sending NP SHOULD perform a `subscriber_reference` registry lookup for the receiving NP's entry on that network's NFO-managed registry **immediately before** dispatching the message. The NFO may have revoked the receiving NP's participation since the last interaction, and a revoked NP MUST NOT be called.

If the receiving NP's `subscriber_reference` record is absent or shows a revoked status, the sending NP MUST NOT send the message and MUST treat the condition as a configuration or trust error rather than a transient failure.

##### 9.2 Key Expiry Check Before Callbacks

A BPP sending a solicited callback SHOULD verify that its own signing key has not expired in the interval between receiving the original BAP request and sending the callback. Because processing latency, queuing, or high system load can introduce delays between a synchronous Ack and the eventual callback, a key that was valid at Ack time may have expired by callback time. A BPP that discovers its signing key has expired MUST rotate to a valid key and update its key record in the GRR before sending the callback.

Additionally, if the BAP's public key was cached during the original request verification, the BPP SHOULD re-verify the BAP's key validity before using the cached value to construct the `request-signature` field. A key that was valid at request time may have been revoked or expired in the interim.

#### 10. Replay Protection

Replay protection rules differ between BAP requests and BPP callbacks because the semantics of the `messageId` field differ for each role.

##### 10.1 BAP Request Replay Protection

A BAP MUST assign a globally unique `messageId` to every outbound request. No two requests from the same BAP, even within the same transaction, may reuse a `messageId`. A BPP or DS receiving a request whose `messageId` matches a previously processed request within its replay detection window MUST reject the duplicate with a `400 NackBadRequest`.

##### 10.2 Solicited Callback Replay Protection

A BPP MUST use the **same** `messageId` as the triggering BAP request in its solicited callback. This shared `messageId` is the mechanism by which the BAP correlates the callback to its outbound request.

The BAP MUST persist the `messageId` of each outbound request until one of the following occurs, whichever is earlier:

- The corresponding solicited callback is received and accepted.
- The `expires` timestamp from the BAP's outbound `Authorization` header for that request passes.

Upon receiving a callback, the BAP MUST verify that the `messageId` in the callback's `context` object matches a `messageId` the BAP has persisted and for which it has not yet received a callback. A callback with a `messageId` the BAP does not recognize, or one for which a callback has already been received, MUST be rejected.

##### 10.3 Provider-Initiated Notification Replay Protection

A BPP sending a provider-initiated notification MUST assign a unique `messageId` to each notification. No two provider-initiated notifications may share a `messageId`. However, the `transactionId` in a provider-initiated notification MUST match the `transactionId` of an active, confirmed transaction between the BAP and BPP. A BAP receiving a provider-initiated notification with an unrecognized `transactionId` MUST reject it with a `400 NackBadRequest`.

### Cross-cutting considerations

#### Clock skew

A tolerance of up to 5 seconds is the recommended default for the `created` field. NFOs MAY configure a stricter or more permissive value for their subnet; when they do, all NPs operating within that subnet MUST use the configured value. NPs MUST NOT accept any tolerance for `expires`; an expired signature MUST be rejected without exception regardless of subnet configuration.

#### Key rotation

When an NP rotates its signing key, the old key MUST remain resolvable in the GRR until all in-flight transactions that used it have expired. The NP MUST update its key registration atomically and MUST NOT sign new messages with the old key after rotation.

#### Privacy

The `keyId` path exposes the NP's namespace identifier in every request header. This is by design: fabric identity is not pseudonymous at the protocol level.

#### Key compromise

If an NP's private key is compromised, the NP MUST immediately revoke the key record in the GRR. The GRR revocation status MUST be checked at verification time; a cached public key from a revoked record MUST NOT be used to verify signatures.

#### Explicit keyId trust

Allowing explicit keyIds pointing to arbitrary registries creates a trust bootstrapping problem. NPs that have not configured explicit trust for a given registry SHOULD default to rejecting such signatures rather than accepting them, to avoid being deceived by rogue registries.

### Migration Notes

The following v1.x patterns are breaking changes in v2.0:

1. **BG removed:** There is no `X-Gateway-Authorization` header in v2.0. BG routing infrastructure MUST be decommissioned or bypassed. Direct BAP ↔ BPP/DS connectivity is required.
2. **Registry protocol change:** The v1.x Beckn Protocol-compliant registry lookup is replaced by dedi protocol-compliant lookup against `fabric.nfh.global/registry`. All registry query code MUST be updated to the dedi protocol API.
3. **Request-signature chaining:** Solicited callbacks now carry the BAP's original signature as the `request-signature` field in the signing string. v1.x callback implementations MUST add this field with `headers="(created) (expires) digest request-signature"`.
4. **Synchronous response signing:** Every response now requires a `Signature` header. v1.x implementations that returned unsigned responses MUST add this.
5. **keyId format change:** The v1.x format `{subscriber_id}|{unique_key_id}|{algorithm}` is replaced by the path-based implicit format `{namespace_id}/{registry_id}/{record_id}|{algorithm}`. Existing key registrations MUST be migrated to the new namespace structure in the GRR before go-live on v2.0.

### Examples

#### Example 1: BAP Request to BPP

**Scenario:** BAP `bap.example.com` sends a `/select` request to BPP `bpp.example.com`.

##### Step 1 — Compute body digest

```
body = '{"context":{"action":"select",...},"message":{...}}'
hash = BLAKE2b-512( UTF-8(body) )
digest = "BLAKE2b-512=" + Base64(hash)
       = "BLAKE2b-512=qK3Uvd39k+SHfSdG5igXsRY2Sh+nvBSNlQkLxzM7NnP4..."
```

##### Step 2 — Construct signing string

```
(created): 1746518400
(expires): 1746518700
digest: BLAKE2b-512=qK3Uvd39k+SHfSdG5igXsRY2Sh+nvBSNlQkLxzM7NnP4...
```

##### Step 3 — Sign and assemble header

```http
POST /select HTTP/1.1
Host: bpp.example.com
Authorization: Signature keyId="bap.example.com/keys/k001|ed25519",algorithm="ed25519",created="1746518400",expires="1746518700",headers="(created) (expires) digest",signature="Base64EncodedEd25519SignatureHere=="
Content-Type: application/json

{"context":{"action":"select","transactionId":"txn-001","messageId":"msg-001",...},"message":{...}}
```

#### Example 2: BPP Synchronous Ack Response

**Scenario:** BPP receives the `/select` request, verifies it, and returns a synchronous `200 Ack`.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Signature: keyId="bpp.example.com/keys/k002|ed25519",algorithm="ed25519",created="1746518401",expires="1746518701",headers="(created) (expires) digest",signature="BPPSignatureOverAckBodyHere=="

{"message":{"ack":{"status":"ACK"}}}
```

The BPP's `Signature` header signs the `{"message":{"ack":{"status":"ACK"}}}` body using the BPP's Ed25519 private key.

#### Example 3: BPP Solicited Callback to BAP

**Scenario:** BPP sends the asynchronous `/on_select` callback to the BAP. The BAP's original `signature` value from Example 1 is `Base64EncodedEd25519SignatureHere==`.

##### Step 1 — Extract BAP's original signature

```
bap_signature_value = "Base64EncodedEd25519SignatureHere=="
```

##### Step 2 — Compute callback body digest

```
callback_body = '{"context":{"action":"on_select","transactionId":"txn-001","messageId":"msg-001",...},"message":{...}}'
digest = "BLAKE2b-512=" + Base64( BLAKE2b-512( UTF-8(callback_body) ) )
       = "BLAKE2b-512=rN4Wve49l+TIfTeH6jhYtCS3Ti+owCTOmRlMyy8OoQQ5..."
```

##### Step 3 — Construct callback signing string

```
(created): 1746518450
(expires): 1746518750
digest: BLAKE2b-512=rN4Wve49l+TIfTeH6jhYtCS3Ti+owCTOmRlMyy8OoQQ5...
request-signature: Base64EncodedEd25519SignatureHere==
```

##### Step 4 — Assemble callback request

```http
POST /on_select HTTP/1.1
Host: bap.example.com
Authorization: Signature keyId="bpp.example.com/keys/k002|ed25519",algorithm="ed25519",created="1746518450",expires="1746518750",headers="(created) (expires) digest request-signature",signature="BPPCallbackSignatureHere=="
Content-Type: application/json

{"context":{"action":"on_select","transactionId":"txn-001","messageId":"msg-001",...},"message":{...}}
```

##### BAP verification

1. Fetch BPP's public key from `https://fabric.nfh.global/registry/dedi/lookup/bpp.example.com/keys/k002|ed25519`.
2. Reconstruct the callback signing string using the four `headers` fields in declared order.
3. Verify BPP's `signature` against the reconstructed string.
4. Extract `request-signature` value: `Base64EncodedEd25519SignatureHere==`.
5. Look up BAP's persisted signature for `messageId=msg-001`. They match → callback is authentic and solicited.
6. Return `200 Ack` with BAP's own `Signature` response header.

## Conclusion

This RFC establishes a bilateral, non-repudiable authentication model for Beckn Protocol v2.0.0 that extends the existing public-key registry trust model with two new guarantees: solicited callback chaining (every callback cryptographically proves it responds to a specific BAP request) and mandatory synchronous response signing (every response proves authenticated receipt). Replay protection rules for BAPs and BPPs reflect their different roles in the message exchange. Together, these mechanisms ensure that every Beckn message can be attributed to a fabric-registered identity and verified independently by any NP without any centralized intermediary.

### Open Questions

1. **Explicit keyId trust model:** Should the spec provide a standard mechanism for NPs to publish their list of trusted external registries, or leave this to operator configuration?

2. **Challenge-response authentication for fabric service callbacks:** Fabric services (NS, GRR, CS) are implicitly trusted by all NPs on the fabric. Given this implicit trust, should the spec define a challenge-response path as the designated verification mechanism for fabric service callbacks, rather than requiring full request-body signature verification? The proposed mechanism: the NP generates a challenge by encrypting `(input || nonce)` with the fabric service's well-known public key and includes it in the outbound request; the fabric service decrypts the challenge using its private key and echoes the plaintext `(input || nonce)` back in the callback response; the NP verifies the echo matches its original plaintext, confirming the callback originated from a party in possession of the fabric's private key. This would be particularly valuable for large payloads such as `catalog/pull` results delivered by the CS to a DS, where computing and verifying a BLAKE2b-512 digest and Ed25519 signature over the full response body is non-trivial. Open considerations include: how the challenge is transmitted (a dedicated request header or a field in the `context` object); whether the response body should still carry a signature for non-repudiation even if the challenge-response is used for source authentication; and whether this mechanism should apply to all fabric service interactions or only to specific endpoints where payload size makes full verification costly.

3. **End-to-end catalog integrity — BPP origin proof through the CS:** When a BPP publishes a catalog to the CS via `/catalog/publish`, the HTTP request signature (defined in §4) authenticates the publish request but does not travel with the catalog payload. When the CS subsequently delivers that catalog to a DS — either via `/on_discover`, a `catalog/pull` callback, or a subscription push — the DS receives a payload signed by the CS, not by the BPP. Implicit trust in the CS means the DS trusts the CS not to tamper, but it provides no independent means to verify that the catalog contents are exactly what the BPP originally submitted. Should the spec require BPPs to produce an application-layer signature over the catalog payload itself (separate from the HTTP request signature) that the CS preserves and forwards verbatim, allowing the DS — and ultimately the BAP — to verify BPP origin and integrity independently of the CS? Open considerations include: where the BPP payload signature is carried (a `signature` field within the `Catalog` schema, or a parallel metadata envelope); whether the CS should validate the BPP payload signature before indexing and reject malformed submissions; how key rotation interacts with previously indexed catalogs whose payload signatures were produced with an older key; and whether end-to-end integrity verification should be mandatory or optional given that the CS is already implicitly trusted.
